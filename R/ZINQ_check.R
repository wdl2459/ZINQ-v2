#' \itemize{
#'   \item It is recommended to do the sanity check before applying ZINQ. If it is necessary, warnings will be printed to guide the analysis using ZINQ.
#'   \item If library size is a confounder of the variable(s) of interest, ZINQ might not control type I error.
#'   \item If there are few non-zero read counts, use ZINQ with caution.
#'   \item For a perfect separation, e.g., there are all zeroes in one group (case or control), which is an extreme case of imbalance, use ZINQ with caution.
#'   \item The sanity check is mainly about zero inflation. Most normalization methods will keep the original zeroes, thus investigating the un-normalized taxa read count table provides sufficient clues to use ZINQ.
#'    For normalization methods not retaining the zeroes. e.g., CLR, results of the sanity check is not informative, one can apply ZINQ directly.

#' @return Print warnings if necessary:

#'   \item When library size is a confounder.
#'   \item For each taxon, (1) when all read counts are zero, (2) when there are limited non-zero read counts (<30 or <15), (3) when there is a perfect separation w.r.t. the variable(s) of interest.
